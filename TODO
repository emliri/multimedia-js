- Socket "probes" / "filters"

- Handle async proc initialization
  -> Handle case like: where MP4-muxer releases codec-info after
     parsing first bits and MediaSource can only be initialized async
  -> Socket has now `whenReady` promise to handle the async-io-socket case in a non-blocking-RAII-like way

- Apply lint rules / Remove console logs

- Filterable logs

- Tool for "online" mp4 / TS / web analysis and diff :)

- AAC parse-proc (like for h264)

- Desynchronize transfer func

- Generalize test-case for flows that take URL as entry point

- Automate running web test-cases

- Also take care of mime-types and 4cc codec strings properly

- Fix Worker/Task scaffold
