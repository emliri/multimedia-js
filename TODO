# Bugs


- Remove all hardcoded values in moz-mp4-mux

- Fix sample-table packager sync-frames list bug




# Use-Cases

- Method to create "grow" new BufferSlice from original data and (list of) additional slices

- Tool for "online" mp4 / TS / web analysis and diff :)

- AAC parse-proc (like for h264)

- Mux to plain mov with moz-mp4-mux (non-fragmented)

# Model design

- Also take care of mime-types and 4cc codec strings properly

# Architecture

- Proxy sockets: *** Run each processor on its own worker and use sockets for messaging *** (- Fix Worker/Task scaffold)

- "Seal" processor (no more sockets added/removed)

- "Block" sockets data flow

- FIFO buffering on sockets (also when not connected yet)

- Socket "probes" / "filters"

- Handle async proc initialization
  -> Handle case like: where MP4-muxer releases codec-info after
     parsing first bits and MediaSource can only be initialized async
  -> Socket has now `whenReady` promise to handle the async-io-socket case in a non-blocking-RAII-like way


# Debugging

- Apply lint rules / Remove console logs

- Filterable logs

# Testing

- Generalize test-case for flows that take URL as entry point

- Automate running web test-cases

- Seperate compile of procs and core

- Essentialize/Cleanup Hlsjs-parser/muxer-parts
