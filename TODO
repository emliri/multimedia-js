- Socket "probes" / "filters"

- Handle async proc / io-socket initialization
  -> Handle case like: where MP4-muxer releases codec-info after parsing first bits and MediaSource can only be initialized async

- Apply lint rules / Remove console logs

- Tool for "online" mp4 analysis / diff

- AAC parse-proc (like for h264)

- Desynchronize transfer
