Hey there. As of v0.8 of multimedia.js, v0 branch is not being maintained anymore (at least here). IT still works anyway fwiw :) Feel free to use it for the use-cases implemented. The last v0 release is here: https://github.com/tchakabam/multimedia.js/commit/b433e471c52cafb18308e859cf740acf3222521c or on NPM :)

**We more than never believe in the need to provide one complete, versatile and modular multimedia pipelines framework to enable creating demanding applications in Browser, Electron, Nodejs or ReactNative etc and allow access to standards implementation under one common generic data-flow API :)**

Currently v2 is under heavy development right here on the master branch :) 

This will be a (more elaborately conceived) core and base components all written in **TypeScript**.

Featuring: way more format support, more use cases, more performance, more magic + many other goodies. Stay tuned.
