Hey there. This version 0.8.x of multimedia.js is not being maintained anymore. IT still works anyway fwiw :) Feel free to use it for the use-cases implemented.

**We more than never believe in the need to provide one complete, versatile and modular multimedia pipelines framework to enable creating demanding applications in Browser, Electron, Nodejs or ReactNative etc and allow access to standards implementation under one common generic data-flow API :)**

Currently v2 is under heavy development here: https://github.com/tchakabam/multimedia.js/tree/v2.0.x

This will be a (more elaborately conceived) core and base components all written in **TypeScript**.

Featuring: way more format support, more use cases, more performance, more magic + many other goodies. Stay tuned.
